# Fault-Detection-System
This code presents an integrated fault detection system for FDM printers using three cameras (2 raspberry pi cameras mounted on the bed and one usb nozzle camera).
It uses 2 pre-trained YOLOv8 models (for the nozzle camera and bed cameras), together capable of detecting 12 different 3D printing errors.
